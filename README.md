# 📘 Javascript\_Learn\_in\_Public

Welcome to Javascript\_Learn\_in\_Public – a personal journey where I learn and share JavaScript concepts, projects, and experiments in public, one step at a time.

## 🚀 About the Project

The aim of this repository is to:

* Practice and improve JavaScript skills in public.
* Share progress and insights as a developer.
* Build a habit of consistent learning.
* Help others by providing clear, understandable code and explanations.

```

Each `part` directory focuses on a specific concept or group of topics. Files are organized for clarity and growth as I progress.
